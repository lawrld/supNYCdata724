# supNYCdata724
Dummy database modeled after Week 7 of Supreme NYC's F/W24 catalog. Made in MySQL.

This project was meant for me to get comfortable with building databases from scratch (specifically end user databases). All populating was done manually (inspect element helps a lot!). It might be a good idea to use a scraper going forward.

There are some kinks in it that I will address eventually, possibly with another DBMS entirely. Thanks for reading.
