# supNYCdata724
Dummy database modeled after Week 7 of Supreme NYC's F/W24 catalog. Made in MySQL.

This project was meant for me to get comfortable with building databases from scratch (specifically end user relational databases). With Supreme being one of my favorite brands, it seemed like a no-brainer. All populating was done manually (inspect element helps a lot!). It might be a good idea to use a scraper going forward.

There are some kinks in it that I will address eventually, possibly with another DBMS entirely. Thanks for reading.
